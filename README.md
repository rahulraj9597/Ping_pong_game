**Project Description**

Two-Player Mode: The game supports two players, each controlling their own paddle to hit the ball back and forth. Players can take turns or compete simultaneously.

Responsive Controls: Players use keyboard inputs to move their paddles up and down, enhancing the gameplay experience with smooth and responsive controls.

Dynamic Ball Movement: The ball bounces off the paddles and walls, simulating realistic physics. The speed and direction of the ball change with each hit, adding to the challenge.

Score Tracking: The game keeps track of each playerâ€™s score, displaying it prominently on the screen. The first player to reach a predefined score wins the game.

**Implementation:**

Turtle Graphics: Utilized for rendering game elements, such as the paddles, ball, and score display.

Game Loop: A continuous game loop manages the game state, including player input, ball movement, and collision detection.

Collision Detection: The program checks for collisions between the ball and paddles, as well as with the game boundaries to create an engaging gameplay experience.
